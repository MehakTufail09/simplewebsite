            Bill Gates was born in Seattle, Washington on October 28, 1955.
            He is the son of William H. Gates Sr.(1925–2020) and Mary Maxwell Gates (1929–1994).
            His ancestry includes English, German, and Irish/Scots-Irish. 
            His father was a prominent lawyer, and his mother served on the board of directors for First Interstate BancSystem and the United Way of America.
            Net Worth: 114.7 billion USD
            
            <h3>Entrepreneural history</h3>

             Gates wrote his first software program at the age of 13. 
            In high school he helped form a group of programmers who computerized their school’s 
            payroll system and founded Traf-O-Data, a company that sold traffic-counting systems to local governments.
           In 1975 Gates, then a sophomore at Harvard University, joined his hometown friend Paul G. Allen to develop software for the first microcomputers.

            They began by adapting BASIC, a popular programming language used on large computers, for use on microcomputers. 
            With the success of this project, Gates left Harvard during his junior year and, with Allen, formed Microsoft. 
            Gates’s sway over the infant microcomputer industry greatly increased when Microsoft licensed an operating system called MS-DOS to 
            International Business Machines Corporation—then the world’s biggest computer supplier and industry pacesetter—for use on its first microcomputer, the IBM PC (personal computer).

            After the machine’s release in 1981, IBM quickly set the technical standard for the PC industry, and MS-DOS likewise pushed out competing operating systems. 
            While Microsoft’s independence strained relations with IBM, Gates deftly manipulated the larger company so that it became permanently dependent on him for crucial software.
            Makers of IBM-compatible PCs, or clones, also turned to Microsoft for their basic software.
            By the start of the 1990s he had become the PC industry’s ultimate kingmaker.

             <strong>Early Life:</strong>
               
                Mark Elliot Zuckerberg was born on May 14, 1984, in White Plains,
                 New York to psychiatrist Karen and dentist Edward Zuckerberg. 
                 He and his three sisters (Arielle, Randi, and Donna) were raised in a Reform Jewish household in Dobbs Ferry, New York.
                  His great-grandparents were Jewish emigrants from Austria, Germany, and Poland. 
                  He attended high school at Ardsley High School before transferring to Phillips Exeter Academy. 
                  He was the captain of the   fencing team.
                 
                  <h3 >Entrepreneural History</h3>
                 
                  Zuckerberg attended Harvard University, where he launched Facebook in February 2004 with his roommates Eduardo Saverin,
                   Andrew McCollum, Dustin Moskovitz, and Chris Hughes. 
                Originally launched to select college campuses, the site expanded rapidly and eventually beyond colleges, 
                reaching one billion users in 2012. 
                Zuckerberg took the company public in May 2012 with majority shares. 
                In 2007, at age 23, he became the world's youngest self-made billionaire. 
                He has used his funds to organize multiple philanthropic endeavors, including the establishment of the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative.
                By August 2005, Zuckerberg had officially changed the company's name to Facebook,
                 and after raising $12.7 million in venture capital, was ready to move the company to the next level.
                The site gradually expanded from college networks to include high school and work groups, and in September 2006, 
                anyone with an e-mail address was allowed to join. Today, Facebook has more than 2.45 billion active users,
                 and is the third most visited website in the world, behind only Google and YouTube.

                Micheal Dell

                </figure>            <strong>Early Life:</strong>
                Dell was born in 1965 in Houston to a Jewish family.
                 His parents were Lorraine Charlotte a stockbroker, 
                  and Alexander Dell, an orthodontist.
                   Michael attended Herod Elementary School in Houston. 
                   He would go on to attend Memorial High School.  
                   In a bid to enter business early, 
                   he applied to take a high school equivalency exam at age eight.
                    In his early teens, he invested his earnings from part-time jobs in stocks and precious metals.
               
                    <h3>Entrepreneural History</h3>
                
                Michael Dell wasn't the only young entrepreneur to ride the computer boom of the 
                late 1980s and early 1990s from rags to riches. Like Rod Canion of Compaq and Steve Jobs of Apple, 
                Dell turned a fledging start-up into a multibillion-dollar computer empire.
                 But unlike the ill-fated Canion and Jobs, who lost control of their creations as they grew,
                  Dell has managed to hold on to the reins of his maverick venture and achieve the unique distinction of being the computer industry's longest-tenured CEO.
                  Dell has made Dell Computer Corp. the world's leading direct computer systems company.
                Dell's parents wanted him to be a doctor. But by the time he was in junior high, Dell was hooked on computers. 
                While most of his classmates were tinkering under the hoods of old cars, Dell loved to tinker with his Apple IIe.
